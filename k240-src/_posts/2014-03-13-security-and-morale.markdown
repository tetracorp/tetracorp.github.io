A colony requires one Security Centre for every 100 colonists
after the first 50, i.e. none for 0-149 colonists, one for
150-249 colonists, and so on.

### Rising Unrest
Each day that a colony goes without sufficient Security Centres,
it gains one point of Unrest, to a maximum of 310 points. Higher
levels of Unrest lead to security events (see below).

After a security event, there is a random delay of 30 to 59 days
before another security event can occur at that asteroid.

A colony with enough Security Centres reduces its Unrest by one
point per day.

For each resource (air, food, water) that is currently unmet by
either production or surplus, a colony gains 2 points of Unrest.

### Unrest Levels
| Points   | Status                   |
|----------|--------------------------|
| 0-40     | ASTEROID SECURE.         |
| 41-99    | LOW MORALE.              |
| 100-199  | SOCIAL UNREST.           |
| 200-299  | MAJOR CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. |
| 300-310  | SECURITY ALERT!          |

### Asteroid Secure
No security breach events happen.

### Low Morale
- Worker strike (50% chance): All mining, shipbuilding, and missile
construction are reduced to 40% of normal speed. Command Centre is
also affected. (No other buildings require workers.) Strike lasts
10-29 days.
- Theft (50% chance): 1,000 - 10,000 credits stolen. If there is not
enough money in general fund to cover the loss, the rest is taken
from Building fund, Vehicle fund, etc, and so on.

### Social Unrest
- Theft (33% chance): 10,000 - 50,000 credits stolen.
- Worker strike (33% chance): Workers strike for 30-99 days.
- Desertion (33% chance): If there are at least 50 colonists,
5-14 disappear from the colony.

### Major Criminal Activity
- Theft (25% chance): 50,000 - 100,000 credits stolen.
- Desertion (25% chance): 10-29 colonists disappear.
- Missile stolen (25% chance): All units of a random missile are
deducted from silos. The missile is chosen at random (any except
Anti-Virus), but if none of the chosen type are available it
tries again with the next two missiles before giving up. Anti-Virus
can therefore be stolen if the thieves attempt to steal Vortex when
there are no Vortex. It may be useful to keep one of each cheap missile
to guard against theft of valuable missiles that follow in the list,
e.g. keep one Scatter, otherwise a failed Scatter theft attempt will
lead you to lose Virus or Mega instead.
- Ship stolen (25% chance): One ship is lost. This will be an
Assault Fighter if any are available, otherwise a Scout Ship.
If no Scout Ships are available, no ship will be stolen.

### Security Alert!
- Theft (20% chance): 100,000 - 500,000 credits stolen.
- Desertion (20% chance): 10-29 colonists disappear.
- Ship stolen (20% chance): Randomly lose one of the following
ships, in order of preference: Assault Fighter, Combat Eagle,
Scout Ship, Transporter.
- Missile stolen (20% chance): Lose all units of a random missile.
- Blueprint stolen! (20% chance): A random blueprint is deleted.
Missing blueprints can be re-purchased as normal from Sci-Tek,
but the consequences can be disastrous in the meantime.
