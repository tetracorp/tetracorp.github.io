title: "Building Hitpoints"
categories: game-mechanics

Each building has a number of hit points. The table here lists each
building's cost, hit points, build time and height (for the purpose of
building scaffold height and turret placement).

### Building Armour
The Building Armour blueprint increases each building's maximum hit points
by 10. This does not automatically affect buildings constructed before acquiring
the blueprint, but a Repair Facility will retrofit old buildings to the new
maximum.

### Protected Buildings
In addition to the laser turret, most "protected" versions of buildings have
more hit points than their non-protected equivalent. The only one which does
not is the Protected Storage Tower.

The strongest Terran building in the game is the Protected Environment
Control, which has 52 hit points or 62 with Building Armour.
